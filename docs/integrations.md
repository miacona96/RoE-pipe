## Information on building your own integration

To publish ebook metadata through the River of Ebooks, you will first need to register an account and then create a publisher.
Verifying your ownership of the publisher's domain will increase the chance that your publisher is whitelisted. Once whitelisted, you will be able to use your publisher's appid (key) and secret to POST metadata through the River. You can view the [API documentation here](docs/api). Publishing books is easy - and once published, each new ebook will be available for downstream consumers to find.
