## About
The River of Ebooks serves as an easy-to-use ebook aggregator. Publishers can send metadata from new and updated ebooks through the River where it will be available for any downstream consumers to read, allowing for a more widely available ebook collection. This way, ebooks can be made available on all end user sites, instead of only the site they were published with.
